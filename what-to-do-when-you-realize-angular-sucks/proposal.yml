  Title: "What to do when you realize Angular.js sucks (aka Angular.js: The bad parts)"
  Description: >
    I fell in love with Angular.js when I started using it years ago but as my
    Angular.js apps have grown they have started to rear Angular's ugly head.
    You will reach this point at sometime in your app's lifetime as it grows.
    Here is what you can do when you run into the bad parts.
