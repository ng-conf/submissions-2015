  Title: Yo HTTP request, I'm really happy for you, Imma let you finish but...
  Description: >    
    If I could go back in time to when I was first learning Angular and teach myself
    something, I would explain HTTP interceptors and transformers in great detail.
    They provide amazing mechanisms for catching errors, removing unwanted data,
    and "fixing" requests and responses. In this practical guide to interceptors and
    transformers I'll discuss why you should be using them if you aren't and suggest
    some new ways to use them that you may not have considered.
