  Title: Improving AngularJS web app performance example
  Description: >
    We have been working on large AngularJS applications that
    include lots of data, lots of D3 charts and reusable components.
    Lately we have started looking at improving the application's performance.
    In this talk I give step by step example show how to profile an
    application using Chrome DevTools code snippets. Lots of charts and graphs
    that show CPU bottlenecks, memory allocation events, timeline profiling
    to improve code / browser interaction. I published the findings in a
    detailed blog post http://bahmutov.calepin.co/improving-angular-web-app-performance-example.html
    Please see the post for the content.
