  Title: ngTasty - Building high performance measurable directives
  Description: >
    My team at Twitter is tasked with building internal tools using agile methodologies with a focus 
    on rapid iteration. This results in a need to build reusable components that we can continually 
    improve upon. With each new project we increase performance of the components used by all of our 
    applications. With input from Jeff Cross, I will discuss how we focus on performance when designing 
    reusable components that are measurably fast. You may already know about Batarang, but how can you 
    use it in conjunction with Benchpress to design, measure, and identify specific areas of improvement 
    in your application? I will present real-life examples from our ngTasty implementations at Twitter 
    that demonstrate how you can use these tools together to develop the fastest directive you have ever made.
