  Title: "Step by Step: Use Material Design and AngularJS to build a first class multi-platform app"
  Description: >
    This talk presents a case study of building a responsive (mobile + desktop),
    highly interactive, tastefully animated Angular app with Material Design.  I will start
    with a review of the design process——highlighting Material Design principles——and
    follow through the steps to implementation. Rather than fixating on specific code details,
    I will focus on the different tools and technologies at play, as well as how to select
    them in the first place and how to bring them all together.
    The final result will be a web app, a mobile browser app, and a mobile native-hybrid app,
    all from a single Angular codebase, and all assembled (with some git time travel) in 20 minutes.
