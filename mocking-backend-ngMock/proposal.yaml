  Title: Mocking Your Backend with ngMock
  Description: >
    If you've been in the industry longer than a few hours, you've encountered a scenario
    where the backend your app communicates with is either down, wrong, or incomplete.
    You may have also written modules that interact with a server that you'd like to test.
    Thankfully, Angular includes the ngMock module that enables you to implement a mock
    backend with a minimal amount of code. With capabilities aimed at both unit testing
    and integration testing, you should definitely get familiar with ngMock.
