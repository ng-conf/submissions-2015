  Title: Classy Angular Code with TypeScript
  Description: >
    TypeScript adds classes, interfaces, modules and optional static typing on 
    top of JavaScript, while still compiling down to vanilla JS. We've spent the 
    last year moving our production codebases to TypeScript. It is awesome. 
    
    In this talk you can learn from our mistakes and experiences. See how you can 
    combine TypeScript classes and Angular's 'controller as' syntax to get super-clean 
    controllers. Or how TypeScript modules help you scale your development. We'll 
    also show you how to adopt TypeScript piecemeal in your existing projects.
