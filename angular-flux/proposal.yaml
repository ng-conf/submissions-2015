  Title: Getting Reactive with Flux Architecture
  Description: >
    Flux Application Architecture is a pattern that allows unidirectional data flow in
    a single direction. The concept was development from React community as a way to reinvent
    app architecture. I will demonstrate an Angular app that uses Flux Architecture conpared to
    the traditional MVC pattern used by most Angular apps today.

      Patrick, aka PatrickJS, leads the engineering team at Keychain Logistics by
      betting big on Angular and realtime. He is a fan of realtime, an advocate
      of code maintainability (coming from a Ruby background), and idiomatic
      programming. When he is not coding for dayz, he spends his time
      watching programming videos or anime with friends.
