  Title: Controller As 'The JavaScript Way'
  Description: >
    Stop including $scope everywhere and get rid of all those explict $watch calls!
    Everything you need for a scalable, responsive Angular app is there, out of the box. 
    Making the jump to the new "controller as" syntax may seem daunting at first. After all,
    don't you still need to rely on $scope (if for nothing else, to watch properties change) 
    and how on earth do you access forms? In this talk, learn how to use controller as and
    modern JavaScript constructs like properties to define POJO models and controllers that
    communicate without having to rely on messaging components, explicit watchers, or $scope.
