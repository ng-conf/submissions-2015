  Title: Writing protractor tests with elementor
  Description: >
    When you write a Protractor test you spend 90% of your time finding and
    testing locators. Elementor allows you test locators against a live
    Protractor session by entering them directly into Chrome or your IDE
    (IntelliJ / Webstorm, and Sublime).
