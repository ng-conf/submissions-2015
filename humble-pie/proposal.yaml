  Title: Eating Humble Pie
  Description: >
    How often do you post your code? I did that once sharing an angular directive.
    Are you ready for positive and negative comments?
    Did you learn from the experience and engage the critic?
    I posted a simple directive that decorates negative currency with some simple css.  I thought I did it correctly however I was wrong, dead wrong.  It turns out I was doing things the wrong way and I learned the angular way to accomplish the same thing easier and with less code.
