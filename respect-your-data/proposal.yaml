  Title: Give Your Data The Respect It Deserves
  Description: >
    Your data is one of your most valuable assets, and it deserves your respect. Angular-data 
    (https://github.com/jmdobry/angular-data) is a robust data store primed to grant any Angular app 
    wisdom beyond its youth. Forget fleets of boilerplate services and dissatisfactory (read buggy) 
    data management, Angular-data supercharges your RESTful (and not so RESTful) data and makes 
    handling it a breeze. Angular-data 2.0 (future) blesses the un-Angularized with a framework-agnostic
    core, bringing a sane data layer to the masses. Switch frameworks while leaving your data layer 
    intact! For ages 3 and up and all those who above all else, desire power (over their data).
