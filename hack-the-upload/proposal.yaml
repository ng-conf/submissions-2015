  Title: Hacking the Upload 
  Description: >
     Uploading files is a magical process with very little leeway. It's mostly automated by your browser but what we should be asking is, what is this sorcery?? Walk through the upload with me and learn how you can hack the file upload with a friendly directive by adding your own form data. This talk will cover what is happening, why it works this way, and what you can do about it. Also blobs.

     Neha Batra is a software engineer at Floored who works on making the internal repository of materials, products, and scenes more accessible to our modelers, clients, and the public.  Prior to Floored, Neha was an energy consultant who quit and picked up programming because “it was time.” She holds a bachelor’s in Mechanical Engineering from MIT and enjoys confusing people as they try to trace her education/work history. Neha likes food, planning trips/vacations (please ask her about her spreadsheets/gdocs/blog posts about this), and pronouncing GIFs how it should be: jiffs.
