  Title: "Famo.us/Angular 2:  The Web Is Winning"
  Description: >
    While there's a lot that's new and exciting in the world of Angular 2,
    Famo.us, too, is rolling out some big features and big changes.  Along
    with these two recrafted libraries, there will be a new integration,
    code-named (shh, this is top secret) 'Famo.us/Angular 2'.  This talk will
    discuss some highlights of the new integration, including some of the major
    improvements from previous versions, some of the design lessons learned,
    and some of the really cool new stuff that developers can do across platforms 
    with the combination of these cutting-edge technologies.
