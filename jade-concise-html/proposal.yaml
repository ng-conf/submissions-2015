  Title: "Jade, a Less Painful Syntax for HTML"
  Description: >
    Angular works on the HTML DOM, and of course the default way to type HTML DOM as text is HTML.
    But default does not mean best. This talk briefly show the How and Why of Jade, an alternative
    syntax for HTML. Jade is concise and indentation-based, shortening your templates considerably.
    Jade lacks the "feature" of unbalanced tags, and can be integrated easily in your AngularJS
    project using grunt, gulp or other tool.
