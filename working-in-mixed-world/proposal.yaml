  Title: Working in a mixed world
  Description: >
    Even in a new startup with new frameworks legacy can develop suprisingly
    quickly. I'll describe how introducing Angular to a large and still
    developing web application allowed us to advance quickly whilst not needing
    to rewrite everything.

    I'll discuss why left things split between two hemispheres of code, and how
    we manage integrating the two hemispheres into one world.

    Integration techniques include injecting services into Backbone, loading
    portions via requireJS, testing an entire application with Protractor
    and building everything with the Google Closure Compiler.
