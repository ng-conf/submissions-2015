  Title: Simple Localization for your Angular App
  Description: >
    This presentation covers a simple service and a set of directives that can be used

    apps out in the wild today.
    Topics covered would include:
      - What is localization
      - Looking up localized translations
      - Tokenizing strings for better localization
      - Directives that can be used for localization
      - Demonstration of how to put it all together
