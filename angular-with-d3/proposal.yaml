  Title: Data Visualization with Angular and D3
  Description: >
    [D3.js](http://d3js.org) is the de facto standard for creating modern, performant
    data visualizations. Rather than a collection of pre-made charts, D3 provides
    a vast toolbox of features capable of creating just about anything you can imagine.
    The possibilities are endless, but sometimes it feels like the learning curve is too.
    This session will introduce the basics of D3 and show the various ways it can be
    integrated into your Angular application. SVG, data binding, and animation, oh my!
