  Title: Factory vs Service vs Provider
  Description: >
    The second most popular question regarding Angular on StackOverflow is one of 'Factory vs Service vs Provider'.
    I wrote a blog post (http://tylermcginnis.com/angularjs-factory-vs-service-vs-provider) which tackles that topic and since then it has become quite popular and has received amazing feedback (see the comments).
    This topic will be perfect for the 5 minute time slot while also helping a lot of people understand, at a deeper level, the differences between those three services.
