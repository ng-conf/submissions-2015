  Title: "It's Not Me, It's You: Breaking up with ng-controller"
  Description: >
    At ng-europe, the Angular team announced Angular 2.0 and the imminent demise of controllers and
    scopes as we know them. This reflects a growing sentiment that ng-controller and hierarchical
    scopes have limitations that make them difficult to develop and test with, and that maybe it's
    time for us to politely go our separate ways. But do we have to wait until Angular 2.0?

    In this talk I'll discuss the advantages and feasibility of banishing ng-controller from your
    Angular 1.x app right now. We'll cover the ins-and-outs of using custom directives instead, as
    well as how to use isolate scopes instead of scope inheritance to manage state across different
    parts of your app. Finally, we'll see how this in turn can simplify testing of your templates by
    letting you leverage existing directive unit testing techniques, rather than relying entirely on
    Protractor.

    Attendees will leave with an understanding of how ditching ng-controller can help them build
    apps that are more modular, less bug-prone and more easily testable. And they'll see how they
    can get a little bit of the future right now by cutting the cord, moving on and starting to
    embrace the component-based approach that is coming in Angular 2.0.
