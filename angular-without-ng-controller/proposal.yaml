  Title: "It's Not Me, It's You: Breaking up with ng-controller"
  Description: >
    At ng-europe, the Angular team announced the imminent demise of controllers and scopes as we
    know them in Angular 2.0. This reflects a growing sentiment that ng-controller and hierarchical
    scopes have limitations that make them difficult to develop and test with, and that maybe it's
    time for us to go our separate ways. But do we have to wait until Angular 2.0?

    In this talk I'll discuss the advantages and feasibility of banishing ng-controller from your
    Angular 1.x app right now. We'll cover the ins-and-outs of using custom directives instead, and
    how to use isolate scopes instead of scope inheritance to communicate state between different
    parts of your app. Finally, we'll see how this in-turn can simplify testing of your templates by
    letting you leverage existing directive unit-testing techniques, rather than relying entirely on
    Protractor.

    Attendees will leave understanding how ditching ng-controller can help them build apps that are
    more modular, less bug-prone and more easily testable. And they'll see how they can get a little
    bit of the future right now by cutting the cord, moving on and starting to embrace the
    component-based approach that is coming in Angular 2.0.
