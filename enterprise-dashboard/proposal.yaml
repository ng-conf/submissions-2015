    Beyond ng-repeat: Building a Responsive and Dynamic Dashboard
  Description: >
    Our team's current project is to create a responsive, customizable, dynamic column-based dashboard
    that can display on a wide variety of devices. Users are able to customize the dashboard with multiple 
    "tiles". To enable this functionality, the team created a dashboard layout engine that can do the following:
     - Load module metadata from a centralized location
     - Lazy load the appropriate Angular modules based on a user's permissions and preferences
     - Compile Tiles from a shared template and place into the appropriate column
     - Update column layout based on screen size without reloading the Tiles
