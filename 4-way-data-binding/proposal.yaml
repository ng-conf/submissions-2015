  Title: 4-Way Data-Binding for Offline Data Synchronization
  Description: >
    You can read, send and delete mail from your mobile email client when you are offline, why not from your
    AngularJS app? Web applications no longer need to be dependent on a server. We need to stop treating offline
    as an error condition. Mobile applications need to be able to work without an internet connection to make
    them useful to your users in more situations.

    Using open-source technologies, such as PouchDb & CouchDb, we will create a 4-way data binding (model, UI,
    local storage & remote storage). Using the Ionic Framework we will walk through the steps of creating a
    mobile application capable of working and persisting offline with a local 3-way data binding. Then we will
    add a remote CouchDb server to enable online synchronization via a 4-way data binding.

    Finally, I will show how you can use the opensource ng-pouchdb library to create your own application.
