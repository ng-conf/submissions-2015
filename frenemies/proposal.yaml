    Frenemies: Why I Hate Angular When I Use It, and Miss It When I Don't 
  Description: >
    Angular's wizardry with two-way data bindings, data filtering and UI state 
    management has made it the darling framework of the front-end community. But 
    sometimes, not understanding what's happening behind the curtain can cause 
    big headaches when something goes wrong, especially for beginners. In this 
    session, we'll look at the growing pains of learning Angular, as told by a 
    developer who was in way over his head when he started using it on client projects.

    Aaron Ladage is a UI engineer for DEG in Overland Park, Kansas. He’s currently 
    obsessed with creating faster, leaner responsive sites, and architecting front-end 
    workflow tools and processes that help other developers do the same. Over the last 
    near-decade, he’s worked on projects for Kashi, Purina and American Century Investments, 
    as well as several universities and K12 districts. He also teaches web development 
    courses at a local community college.

    Kansas City BBQ snob and brews some really bad beer. He also recently co-created Yeo+Lab, 
    a front-end website scaffolding tool, with his DEG teammates.
