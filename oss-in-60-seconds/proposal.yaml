    Ever noticed a typo or out of date instructions in an open source repository?
    You probably felt like submitting a patch, but thought it was too much hassle
    for something so minor. In 5 minutes, I can show you a workflow for submitting
    patches in less than a minute. Perfect for OSS n00bs and old vets alike.
