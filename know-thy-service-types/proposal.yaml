Session:
  Title: Know Thy Service Types
  Description: >
    Deciding how to create your own services is not as easy as heeding the 
    dismissive "just use a factory" advice from the coworker with two weeks 
    more Angular experience. A better approach is to take a step back and 
    understand providers. They are the foundation for all of the service 
    creation functions available in the framework. Understand providers 
    and the subtle differences between the five service types will no longer 
    seem subtle. They will become crystal clear and you will use them each 
    correctly and with confidence.
