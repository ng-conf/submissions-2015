  Title: Building a Build Tool Called Gib 
  Description: >
    Since well before single page apps we've used build tools to automate 
    tasks for our static assets.  Today a good build system not only prepares
    assets for production but makes the development process faster and more
    enjoyable.  Among my favorites is the grunt-based NGBP.  Building Gib,
    I have borrowed the best best ideas of NGBP, re-written them using gulp,
    and wrapped them in an npm for easy use and maintenance accross multiple
    projects.  Build systems do not have to be boilerplate.
