  Title: Advanced AngularJS debugging techniques
      Most developers are comfortable using the Javascript debugging tools in their favorite browser,
      but don't know some of the hidden secrets Angular placed in its API for accessing
      controllers, scopes, the injector and other hidden gems.

      In this talk I'll review a typical Angular application that uses services, directives, multiple, nested
      controllers, and data in various scopes, and show you how to debug into and test aspects of the
      application by interacting with it using the simple Chrome Console.  Put on your hacker hats, 
      it's time to dig in and play.
