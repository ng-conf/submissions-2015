  Title: High Speed Angular with RxJS
  Description: >
    Angular is performant enough for most apps, most of the time; But what happens when you're trying to push every drop of performance out
    of your browser app? How can you handle a fire hose of data from socket pushes streaming to your UI while you've got mouse hover events
    firing, without things locking up? Reactive programming is your answer. RxJS is a robust library of tools to handle streams of data in
    amazing ways and it integrates well with any framework. This talk will focus on strategies for using RxJS to alleviate computational stress
    and complexity in your app.
