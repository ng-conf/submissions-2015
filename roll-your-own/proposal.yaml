  Title: Thinking Outside the Library - Rolling Your Own Widget to Improve User Experience
  Description: >
    When have you needed something that nobody had built yet? We needed to give our users a clean and
    elegant faceted search experience, but had so many widgets to choose from, and none was the right
    fit. We started with an existing AngularJS widget that did not quite meet our needs as-is and
    developed a customized faceted search bar to delight our users and de-clutter our UI. We will
    share UX tips and the technical design we went through so you can see the process for yourself. 
    Categories include: AngularJS, JQuery, Foundation, User Experience, widgets, search
