  Title: "Inception: Attacking Common Problems At The Source"
  Description: >
    You know the kind of problems I'm talking about... the kind that infect your code like the plague,
    spreading into every possible corner of your code requiring you to repeat yourself over and over again.
    Security, error handling, boilerplate code that leaches itself onto every controller and service you write.
    Surely there is a better way? Luckily, Angular's amazing dependency injection gives us all the tools we need
    to attack these problems at the source. Using interceptors and decorators we can solve cross cutting problems
    and only have to write the code once. Learn how to leverage this power and start writing less code today.

    Josh is just a dude who loves to program and write things that run on the web. Ever since he was in
    elementary school and wrote his first HTML 1.1 website, he was in love with the potential reach that
    the internet and a browser could offer. Although he is a full stack developer, Josh spends a lot of his
    time these days hacking on Angular applications in JavaScript. He is co-organizer of the KnoxJS user group,
    and loves to speak and write about web technologies. He is also lucky enough to work for Wintellect who pays
    him to do all these things.
