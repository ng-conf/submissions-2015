  Title: Sane $http Error Handling
  Description: >
    One of the challenges in building single-page applications on top of large
    RESTful interfaces is handling the multitude of $http errors in a clean DRY
    testable manner. 400, 401, 422, 500, etc... In the next 20 minutes I will
    share with you my approach to normalizing the handling, response, and testing
    of $http errors against a large RESTful API. You will learn to bucket errors,
    keep UI up-to-date, and minimize headaches.
