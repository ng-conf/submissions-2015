  Title: Sprinkles: Writing Rails-flavored AngularJS
  Description: >
    After spending more than a year trying to reconcile how Rails plays with Angular, not only have I been unsuccessful,
    but I have not been satisfied with any of the suggested solutions. There is a ton of material on the numerous Rails
    hacks you should employ so that Rails and AngularJS feel compatible; however, Iâ€™m beginning to wonder whether this
    is being approached from the wrong direction. The Angular Sprinkles gem offers a fresh take on this problem and uses
    established Rails conventions to dynamically generate an AngularJS application on page load time. My talk will
    highlight the benefits and interesting patterns created by writing applications in this style.
