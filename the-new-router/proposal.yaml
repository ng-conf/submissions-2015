  Title: The New Router
  Description: >
    You may have heard rumors of a new Angular Router.
    In this talk, I'll show off the new router in Angular 1 with a focus on building large, maintainable, modular applications.
    I'll also touch on how this router will work in Angular 2, and how it can serve as a stepping stone for migrating your application.
