  Title: Rapid Prototyping With AngularFire
  Description: >
    I've been working on a CMS using Firebase as a datastore and AngularFire for the admin-facint side of the app.
    The initial build out has been ridiculously fast with the new AngularFire 0.8.0 release, and I've got a few tips
    and tricks to present for anyone interested in building out a production-worthy Firebase project.
    I could talk at length about any of the following topics:
    Firebase, AngularFire 0.8.0 and FirebaseSimpleLogin.
    See the project repo here: https://github.com/deltaepsilon/quiver-cms
    The gist of the project architecture is Node/Express/Angular/Firebase with FirebaseSimpleLogin for auth. The admin
    for the app is entirely in AngularFire. The content created in the admin part of the app is then served up via a
    simple Node/Express/Handlebars theme system with a very simple Redis cacheing layer.
    This architecture prevents excessive concurrent users on Firebase, which keeps down your Firebase costs. Once
    the cache is warmed, Firebase bandwidth goes nearly to zero with only a single connected user unless an admin logs
    in to make edits.
    This architecture also sidesteps any SEO issues by serving up completely bootstrapped/static pages.
    As a nice little bonus, you can run the admin and user-facing parts of the application separately,
    disabling the admin entirely without impacting the performance of the user-facing site.
    I've got all of my high-priority admin functionality working. I'm currently developing a default theme for the CMS
    and I hope to use this project in production before the year is out.

  bio: >
    Chris was skiing with the founder and ex-ceo of his last employer when the founder called Chris out as "uncommitted
    to his side projects" because he "would quit his job if he were truly committed." It took six months for Chris to
    do just that, and now he and his wife Melissa build online businesses for fun and change daipers for work.
    Chris has been using Angular exclusively since striking out on his own in 2013.
    He tries to bike six days a week through the summer and ski as much as his wife will allow through the winter.
