  Title: How Angular and React Complement Each Other
  Description: >
    Nothing's wrong with Angular. But if you wanted to augment it with a view-specific
    library like React, you'd find that the two actually complement each other well. Angular
    brings with it a solid architecture and ecosystem for building complete web applications
    along with an unparalleled open source community. But if we are strictly talking about views,
    React has an advantage with its virtual DOM and synthetic events.

    So there are a few use cases where you would want to delegate the view to React instead of
    keeping it in Angular. I'd like to discuss how ngReact facilitates a smooth interaction of
    React with Angular without losing all of the things that makes Angular great.
