Session:
  Title: Rigorous and Professional Javascript
  Description: >
    We have a duty, an obligation, to our clients and users to be diligent in our craft. Javascript is wonderful, we can do whatever we want. Javascript is horrible, we can do whatever we want. It's a choice between those two paths.

    Luckily we live in a age of killer tooling and can draw on the experience of those that preceded us. Let's build killer applications that are a pleasure to use AND develop.

    This brief discussion will be about software craftsmanships, and what it means for modern web development. We will take a short survey of the best tools, books, and resources to achieve rigorous and professional Javascript.
