  Title: All the Transclusions. Making Smart Wrapper Directives with Transclusion
  Description: >
    Our team is tasked with building a large scale application in AngularJS that is a dashboard and frame for other, sub-applications.
    We are also tasked with developing standards and best practices for HTML5 and AngularJS that will include hundreds of other developers as our company transitions into the modern web landscape.
    Currently, the project involves dozens of developers working on various pieces simultaneously.
    Functional containers are an important piece of this large puzzle.  
    We found directives and transclusion to be incredibly useful in creating these containers.
    From the UX point of view, we have greater control of styling and animation. 
    From the developer side, we can provide simple API's for things like container state or dropping other directives into pre-defined buckets so the developer of the container's content doesn't have to worry about the details.
    Using composition as a guiding principal, and using transclusion to allow the directives to remain generic, we provide a toolset for other developers to make infinite variations of base components.
    As the needs of our application change, developers can create new components that meet these needs.
