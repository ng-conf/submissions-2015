Session:
  Title: i18n for Angular Applications
  Description: >
    We live in a globalized world, so why is your Angular application only in English?
    In this talk, we'll discuss what internationalization actually means to you, the developer,
    and how we need to think about the text of the app, as well as any date/times and numbers.
    Finally, we'll look at some great libraries out there to help make localizing your app super easy.
