  Title: Realtime AngularJS apps with SailsJS
  Description: >
    Build your own websocket powered, 3-way bound, automagically updating, data-centric, AngularJS apps powered by SailsJS.
    Choose your own adventure - use $sailsSocket to replace boring $http, or go full-awesome with $sailsResource - the missing Model layer for Angular.
    We'll build an Ionic app to replace your boring iMessage app, in less time than it takes the NSA to hack your text messages.
