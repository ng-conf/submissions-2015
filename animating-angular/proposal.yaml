  Title: Animating Angular
  Description: >
    When asked about the best thing of Angular, many people are quick to point to
    its fantastic two-way binding feature. With ngAnimate, it is exceptionally easy
    to add a little spice to that great feature. I will show everyone how simple it is
    to get up and running with ngAnimate, demonstrate some of my favorite tips and tricks,
    and delve into some advanced strategies for combining CSS and JS animations using
    the GreenSock Animation Platform (GSAP).
