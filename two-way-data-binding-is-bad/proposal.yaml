  Title: "Two-Way Data Binding is Horrible and You Shouldn't Use It"
  Description: >
    Working with tons of data in your Angular app is made relatively easy thanks
    to the way data-binding is handled almost seemlessly with services, templates,
    and directives. But sometimes, having 300 objects on your page constantly updating
    is a horrible idea. This talk discusses when you should use one-way data-binding
    over two-way, why should you care, and some metrics to justify much of this reasoning.
