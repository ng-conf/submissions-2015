  Title: Embrace The Complexity
  Description: >
    AngularJS directives have been criticized for being overly complex. A developer needs to
    know too many concepts (scope, compile/link, transclusion, etc.) in order to be productive
    with directives. Though this is a valid concern, this complexity is due to the rich
    set of features and expressiveness that directives bring to building robust user experiences.
    Directives provide a great abstraction for creating custom controls that can be readily used
    within your team. Directives can define their own specialized API through scope binding. Directives can
    easily communicate with each other to coordinate functionality. I hope in this talk to demonstrate
    the power of directives and why it is worth pushing through this initial complexity to really
    learn how to use them effectively.
