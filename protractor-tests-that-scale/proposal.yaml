Session:
  Title: Protractor Tests that Scale
  Description: >
    Inspired by last year's excellent talk, "Angular Directives that Scale", I intend to address
    some of the missing gaps on the testing side of things. When developers and testers begin to
    blur the line of what is expected from eachother, wonderful things are possible. I will also focus on
    the most important optimization you can invest into your end to end tests -- optimizing for readability.

  bio: >
    I decided to backpack around the West Coast instead of going to a state university.
    Fortunately, I discovered a love of computers before I spent any money...I'm a late bloomer.
    Nowadays, I work as a Software Developer in Test at Rackspace Hosting, Inc. in San Antonio, Texas.
    I feel fortunate to realize that I finally found a place to work that has SDETs write code all day.
