  Title: Accessiblity and Angular in 5 Minutes
  Description: >
    One of the greatest problems with the trend towards single page applications
    heavy on JavaScript is we tend to forget about users who rely on adaptive
    technologies such as screenreaders.  I propose to spend 5 minutes describing
    basic techniques that can be used to make sure we make our applications
    accessible for everyone.  I intend to speak primarily speak about the ngAria
    directive and properly implementing DOM elements.
