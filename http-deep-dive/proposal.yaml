  Title: A Michael (Squints) Palledorous dive into $http
  Description: >
    $http is likely one of the most used services provided by the AngularJS core, but many times it is used sub-optimally or just downright wrong.
    In this talk, we'll do a deep dive into patterns, anti-patterns (to avoid), and best practices of using $http in angular as well as chat about some of
    the lesser-known features of the service that make interacting with your server a much more pleasant experience. Who knows, after this stunt, you may
    even end up kissing a lifegaurd!
