  Title: "Security Considerations for Enterprise Angular Applications"
  Description: "Security considerations are paramount in enterprise applications.  In our drive to deliver the richest possible user experience, we are  challenged with how to effectively secure our	applications. Single Page Applications balance the distribution between client and server processing, leaving different aspects of security spread across the tiers.  This session covers the security impact when moving greater amounts of your application into the browser realm, security considerations when dealing with sensitive information, and pitfalls of integrating into enterprise-scale security platforms."
