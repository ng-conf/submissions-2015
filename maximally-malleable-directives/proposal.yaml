Session: 
  Description: |
      Ever found that so-close-to-perfect directive, but then discovered
      you'd need to munge its template or (even worse) hack its JavaScript
      to make it fit the look and feel of your application? Ever fork a
      directive just to tweak the CSS?
      
      Break the cycle! You can do better! This presentation will explain
      how to build components that are flexible and configurable, and
      therefore usable under the widest possible circumstances. We'll
      cover...
      
      * Creating directives that allow adding capabilities without changing their code
      
      * Decomposing monolithic directives to increase reusability
      
      * Crafting templates that can be styled without exposing their internal structure
      
      * Providing solid defaults without locking a directive into a specific appearance and behavior
      
      As a bonus, we'll briefly cover how to coerce some of those
      less-than-flexible directives into doing your bidding with the least
      additional effort -- and without forking!

  bio: |
      Bill has been some form of software designer, developer, or systems
      architect for well over two decades. For the last several years,
      he's served as an independent consultant and senior software
      developer for companies (very) large to (very) small all across the
      U.S. Heâ€™s an active member of the Open Source community, and even
      served as president of the Perl Foundation for a couple of years
      (but try not to hold that against him). These days, he divides his
      time between building large, complex web applications, and training
      others to build large, complex web applications.
