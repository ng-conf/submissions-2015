  Title: DevOps for Angular Apps
  Description: >
    Are you using ng-annotate in your Grunt or Gulp build? You have a front-end build process right?
    As web applications grow in sophistication and scope, it becomes increasingly important
    to apply the same DevOps rigor to the front-end that is often more focused on the back-end.
    In this talk we'll dive into how to setup an Angular focused front-end continuous delivery workflow that
    encompasses: building and optimizing assets, running both Karma unit tests and Protractor
    integration tests, and automating the final deployment leg to production. Expect a live-onstage
    production code push demonstrating the process in action.
