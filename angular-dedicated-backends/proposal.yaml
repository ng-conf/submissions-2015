  Title: What about a backend in my AngularJS?
  Description: >
    With the new powers of the browsers, and growing motivations behind offline
    mode, more and more usualy backend tasks have been moved to the front.
    Backend-as-a-Service reached big attention giving even more power to
    front-end developers. But what if any JS developer could easily create his
    own backends-as-a-service dedicated for his apps and seamlessly usable from
    AngularJS? Imagine your Business Rules code implemented once, applied on the
    client, but still enforced by the server... And what if we could navigate
    throught millions of objects from a database as if they were just directly
    in my front-end angular app? That could be great... Guess what? It's already
    possible!
