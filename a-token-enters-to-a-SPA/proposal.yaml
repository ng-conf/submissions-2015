  Title: A token enters to a SPA...
  Description: >
    Everybody has been creating Single Page Apps lately.
    They look neat and fast. Handling authentication in an SPA can be tricky though:
    Cookies, Tokens, Right to access URLs and Resources. What should we use?
    In this talk, I explore all these options: pros and cons. I end up with a live
    coding sample in which I add authentication to a real app.
