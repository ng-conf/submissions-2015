  Title: Migrating a Large, Actively Maintained Application to Angular
  Description: >
    AOL/Advertising.com has an existing web application, written in Java on the
    backend and with ~100k lines of Javascript on top of ExtJS (3.4). The
    application has been in production for three years. We made the decision to
    split the Javascript UI component from the Java backend so that we could
    speed up development and move toward a more continuous deployment model. We
    also decided to migrate from the old version of ExtJS to Angular, so we
    could take advantage of all the work being doing around it. The application
    is large enough that we could not simply stop work on it to do a complete
    port to Angular however, so we had to integrate the new Angular parts of
    the application with the existing ExtJS interface, while moving towards our
    continuous integration and deployment goals. I'll talk about the main
    technique we use, iframes to the new Angular based web application built
    into the existing one, and other lessons learned during the (still going!)
    changeover.
