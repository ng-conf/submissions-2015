  Title: Building a Home Automation System with Angular
  Description: >
    Ken recently moved into a new house and decided it was time to fulfill his life-long dream of building a home
    automation system. He quickly became frustrated with the limited features available in off-the-shelf systems. Armed
    with an API and a few basic angular skills, he built MOAHAS, the mother of all home automation systems. Using
    angular and express, it enables complex programmatic control of lights and sensors throughout his
    house using a simple, intuative interface.
