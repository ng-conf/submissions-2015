  Title: Creating MVP Apps with Ionic Framework and Firebase
  Description: >
    Step away from the paper napkin! Do you have a great app idea but are light on the skills 
    necessary to make it a reality?
    Don't spend many tens of thousands developing an app and backend before even speaking to
    a customer.
    Using Ionic Framework and Firebase, you can build an MVP in a few days. Use the app to get
    feedback from customers and investors and then iterate some more.
