Session:
  Title: Building Platforms with angular.js
  Description: >
    While we often see angular.js used to quickly build small applications,
    it also has the power to drive large frameworks.  Learn how Google has 
    used angular.js to build infrastructure and libraries that support the
    Google Cloud Developer web console.  We'll talk about challenges the 
    team has experienced and how we've handled them, from implementing 
    lazy-loading to assuring consistency and quality across many separate 
    contributing teams.
