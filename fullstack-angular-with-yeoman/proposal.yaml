    Don't get stuck building the same old boilerplate for your web app. Give yourself a head start with Yeoman. Quickly scaffold your AngularJS app with an express backend and database, a modular structure following best practices, websockets, authentication, an easy deployment process, and much more, using the Angular Fullstack generator.
