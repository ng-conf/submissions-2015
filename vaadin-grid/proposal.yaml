  Title: Vaadin Grid component for AngularJS
  Description: >
    While Vaadin Framework has solely been available to Java developers in the
    past, we have just released two things that are interesting to front-end
    developers using AngularJS. 1) Vaadin client-side widgets are now usable 
    independently of the Java Framework as web components. 2) Vaadin has a
    new Grid component that makes scrolling through millions of rows butter 
    smooth and allows customizing presentation with cell renderers. In this 
    session we will show by example how one can start using the Apache licensed
    Vaadin Grid with AngularJS in plain JavaScript.
