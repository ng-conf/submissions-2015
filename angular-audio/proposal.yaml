  Title: Angular Audio - Audio the Angular Way
  Description: >
    Angular Audio is a library I have developed used by the community to integrate sounds 
    into Angular.js projects. The library takes an "angular" approach by taking the
    difficult to access properties of HTML5 Audio and turning them into bindable values.
    This talk serves both to explain the technical details of the library's operation, as
    well as an opportunity to discuss what makes a plugin "angular" in nature.
