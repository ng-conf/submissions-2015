  Title: Searchability and Performance in AngularJS 
  Description: >
      Everyone loves ng-repeat and two-way data binding until it you have the problem you've always wanted to have, too many data points, along with the problem you've never wanted to have, no way of finding what you want when you want it. With a few custom directives and a quick ng-repeat hack, you can not only filter your data effectively, but you can cut down a 15s or 30s search to 2s! Look under the hood with me to figure out why, how, and what now.
