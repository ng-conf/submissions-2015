  Title: ngModel validation: Barry Allen Style
  Description: >
    Quick as a flash, we're going to go over the new $validators pipeline and
    the ngMessages module to validate user input like a boss. The new pipeline
    makes validation much easier to accomplish (even asynchronos validation
    is a much easier story now) and combine that with ngMessages and there's no
    telling how super powerful you'll be after this lightning fast talk.
