  Title: Finding Your Right Route
  Description: >
    First there was ngRoute for URL management and navigation. Then ui-router gave us nested views
    and route states. Coming soon is version 1.3.x routing. Then on to Routing 2.0.
    How do you find the right route for you? Join Deborah as she outlines the pros and cons
    of today's routing options.
