  Title: Refactoring Angular Apps for Epic Growth
  Description: >
    Angular is a great framework! However, it's not a silver bullet. Easy
    decisions today lead to extreme difficulty later on at scale, but it's not
    obvious which ones are safe and which are dangerous. To combat this
    uncertainty, we must design our apps to be refactored and be vigilant about
    fighting cruft. We will share our insights from scaling Rackspace Cloud
    Intelligence from a simple prototype to a large production app supporting
    customers who need to monitor thousands of servers with up-to-the-minute
    metrics. Specifically, we will discuss how we changed our approach in
    writing and composing directives that led to epic wins in both scale and
    developer experience.
