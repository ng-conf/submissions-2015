  Title: ngEnterprise: Scale Your Angular App to the Enterprise Level 
  Description: >
    Writing Angular apps via tutorials is all well and good, but how do you know your code will work when you've got
    hundreds, thousands, even millions of users? Many things change at the enterprise level, from code structure to
    performance, and you'll need to prepare your codebase to scale not only for performance, but for a larger team.
    This talk will explore both performance and scalability considerations when taking your Angular apps from toys
    to enterprise-level applications, using a real-world example of an enterprise Angular application.
