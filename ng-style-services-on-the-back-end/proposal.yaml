  Title: NG Style Services on the Back End
  Description: >
    While developing the Node.js framework called Synth, I ran into a problem
    implementing middleware. I found Node.js middleware too cumbersome to use.
    Hitting upon the idea of Angular style dependency injection, most tasks that
    were accomplished with middleware are now better implemented as back-end
    services. I'll go over the benefits of services on the back-end, and show
    how to use them yourself.
