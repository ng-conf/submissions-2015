  Title: Finding order in Angular 2.0
  Description: >
    Everything is dead now in Angular 2.0. This means that we have more freedom
    to organize applications as we want and have code that is compatible with
    any framework or library.
    However, with a great power comes a great responsibility.
    In this session, we'll learn how we can create organized and
    mantainable projects using AtScript and ES 6.0.
