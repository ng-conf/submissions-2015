  Title: Reactive Angular
  Description: >
    There's been a lot of talk about Reactive Programming lately,
    but nobody really knows exactly what it is.
    I'll first talk a little bit about what Reactive Programming is and then we'll dive into
    practical examples on how to use it with AngularJS.
    We'll see how beautiful and clean our code can be when we use Reactive code with Angular.
