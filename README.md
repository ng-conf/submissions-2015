# [ng-conf 2015](http://ng-conf.org/) submissions

ng-conf 2015 is March 5-6th 2015 in Salt Lake City, Utah. 
We're looking for speakers who are passionate about sharing deep insights, useful tools, and crazy awesome ideas.


We do not tolerate any form of harassment. See our code of conduct document [here](http://www.ng-conf.org/2014/public/downloads/anti-harassment.pdf).

We couldn't possibly answer all of your questions with this simple README.md, so please feel free to reach out to us with questions: info@ng-conf.org

## Deadline

The deadline for submissions is November 1st, 2014.

## Travel

We cover the hotel and reimburse up to $500 in travel costs. And of course, you attend the conference for free. If you have any questions about travel and accommodation costs, please email us at info@ng-conf.org.

## We Can Help

If you are nervous about proposing a talk please don't let that stop you. First time presenters are more than welcome. If you would like to run your ideas by someone feel free to contact @iammerrick on Twitter or via email at info@ng-conf.org. We are happy to brainstorm and review your ideas and interests with you. If you need more encouragement check out this [fantastic website](http://weareallaweso.me/) by Tiffany Conroy. 

## How to Submit a Proposal

1. Fork this repository
2. Create a new directory with a short name (no spaces) that represents your topic e.g. 'rich-ng-models' or 'loving-promises'.
3. In that directory add a high quality 500x500 picture of yourself, named `profile.jpg`, to be used in the schedule if your submission is selected.
4. In that directory create a "proposal.yaml" file, using the [proposal template](./template/proposal.yaml).
   Make sure the file remains [valid yaml](http://yamllint.com/).
   For sessions with multiple speakers just add a "Speaker2" following the same format.
5. Commit your changes and submit a [pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request) back to this repo.
6. If you have multiple proposals, repeat this process for each submission

Selected submissions will have their pull request merged into master. Best of luck!

For multiple proposals please split them into separate pull requests. To do this with git you just have to create a new branch for each proposal, push them both to github, and open a pull request for each.
