  Title: First Class AngularJS Automation
  Description: >
    A question I've been often asked is "How do I integrate AngularJS with {{MY_[FAVORITE|FORCED]}} server stack?"

    The answer is simple. You don't.

    AngularJS apps should be first class applications. Not something you wedge into an existing server technology. The very first step to achieving this is rock solid automation.
    
    Let's talk about the tools we have at our disposal. Gulp, Grunt, Karma, Protractor meets Jenkins, Travis, and CodeShip. Build an army of robot minions to help build your first class AngularJS applications.
