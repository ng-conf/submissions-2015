  Title: Too Many Packages. Managing Dependencies and Packages in Enterprise Applications with AngularJS and RequireJS.
  Description: >
    Our team is tasked with building a large scale application in AngularJS that is a dashboard and frame for other, sub-applications.
    Each application, including the dashboard and frame, consists of a mobile and desktop version. 
    Functionality is also shared between applications and with the Global Frame.                  
    We use RequireJS to load our individual application components as well as the configuration objects for those applications.
    We present a pattern that allows us to define shared modules and require path configurations in a common place and use RequireJS to create unique combinations of configurations for each application.
    This allows a single developer to add features and modules to all applications by making changes once instead of adding the configurations to each individual application.
    Ultimately this makes our application scalable, more maintainable and reduces the amount of duplicated configuration.
