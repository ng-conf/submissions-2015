  Title: Desktop applications and interaction with hardware devices using CEF (Chromium Embeded Framework)
  Description: >
    IOLab is a low-cost, easy-to-use, all-purpose handheld sensor device for student that performs
    a myriad of functions and measurements for both introductory and advanced physics courses.
    The device is currently under its last development phase and expected to be launched early 2015.

    This talk will demonstrate how AngularJS can be used to develop desktop applications
    communicating with hardware devices (USB, serial ports, etc.).
    The speaker will guide attendees through the IOLab software platform which combines
    a unique set of technologies: low level C++ programming, CEF (Chromium Embedded Framework),
    BSON database, Angular and D3!
