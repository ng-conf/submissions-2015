  Title: Advanced Angular Error Instrumentation
  Description: >
    Something terrible happened here. Traces of errors litter the floor; memory
    leaking from cracks in the ceiling. Someone lost their object context in
    the corner. Everything reeks of jank. In this session, a JavaScript error
    tracking expert breaks down common AngularJS crimes, and tools to monitor
    for them. You’ll leave the session armed with techniques and tools to
    detect, diagnose, and fix your JavaScript web applications. Bring your bugs
    and let’s fix up our web.
