  Title: AngularJS for Enterprise Apps
  Description: >

    Morgan Stanley has been one of the early adopters of AngularJS. Our internal UX framework built 
    with AngularJS has helped us rapidly create more than 30 new large scale financial applications 
    that are used by our internal staff and clients. 
    I will walk through our journey with AngularJS by discussing:

      - why and how AngularJS works for enterprise
      - design best practices for large business applications  
      - performance considerations
