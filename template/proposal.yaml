Session:
  Title: The Swanson Pyramid of Greatness
  Description: >
    I have been developing the Swanson Pyramid of Greatness for years.
    It’s a perfectly calibrated recipe for maximum personal achievement. 
    Categories include: Capitalism, God’s way of determining who is smart, and who is poor.
    Crying, acceptable at funerals and the Grand Canyon. Rage. Poise. Property rights. 
    Fish, for sport only, not for meat.
    Fish meat is practically a vegetable.
