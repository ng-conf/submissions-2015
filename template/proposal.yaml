  Title: Embrace SVG with Angular and D3
  Description: >
    As soon as you think about SVG, D3 pops to your mind. However, Angular does not
    need D3 to embrace and take advantage of SVG. As of Angular 1.3 one can easily
    create SVG directives using the templateNamespace attribute.
    This talk is built on the experience acquired through 3 real-world web platforms.
    Each of them takes advantage of SVG in very different ways:
    - a drawing interface for an energy simulator (warmup.greenwatch.com,  with D3)
    - an interactive dental chart for a social network (dentisphere.com, AngularJS only)
    - an interactive visualization of large datasets for an educative framework (IOLab, with D3)
    Attendees will learn patterns to integrate D3 with AngularJS,
    but also how AngularJS excels in SVG directive without D3.
