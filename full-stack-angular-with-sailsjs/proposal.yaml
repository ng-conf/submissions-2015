  Title: One Stack to Rule Them All
  Description: >
    "What backend should I use with Angular?" A question that can be answered differently
    for every set of requirements. "How can I build an Angular application with seamless
    client and server ORM integration, configurable real time synchronized data models,
    model-based validation, and store transactional data in Postgres, documents in Mongo,
    faceted search in Elastic, all while writing less boiler-plate code?" Answer: SWAN.JS.

    Okay, so SWAN.JS isn't really a thing yet. But it's coming! And what is it? It's a
    customized stack of open-source libraries built on Sails.js, Waterline ORM, AngularJS,
    and Node.js (shortened to SWAN.JS cuz, well, we don't have enough acroynms in our lives).

    "So it's like the MEAN stack?" Well, yes, but not so "mean". MEAN.JS is a great stack,
    but is limited out of the box to building MongoDB-based applications. SWAN.JS doesn't
    care what backend technology you use. "So it does real-time data sync like Firebase?"
    Yep! Firebase is wonderful at providing a real-time data model, but what about when
    you need classic relational data? Or how about composing your model with a mix of
    relational and document-based storage?

    In this session we will take a look at a SWAN.JS application template and walk through
    building a just-slightly-more-than-trivial application (hey, we only have 20 minutes!)
    including authentication, authorization, data models (client and server), validation,
    and real-time messaging.
