  Title: "How we whitelabeled: technology is free. The choice is yours."
  Description: >
    A worldwide corporate client, a faceted semi-SPA (partially with routing)
    real-time search in Backbone.js introduced in 2011. Wow-effect back then.
    Fast forward to 2013, a well-known brand wants a whitelabel with reorganized content.
    Backbone.js messes with the logic and content. We make a leap of faith — Angular.
    We need to change the CSS AND HTML, semi-SPA means we could rewrite screen by screen.
    The codebase is shared between Backbone and Angular,
    it was only static HTML that was changed — essentially we got whitelabel for free.
