Session:
  Title: How to Migrate
  Description: >
    When Angular 2 was announced, many developers were concerned with the migration path.
    This talk will not cover how to migrate from Angular 1 to 2.
    Instead, it will discuss how to build the tools to make migration easier.
    I'll show some of the tools I created in building the New Angular Router to make it work in both Angular 1 and 2.
    I'll also discuss static analysis, faÃ§ades, and general techniques for dealing with change in software dependencies.
