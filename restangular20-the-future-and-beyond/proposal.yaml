  Title: > Restangular 2.0: The future and beyond
  Description: >
    Restangular is a REST client specifically made for AngularJS which helps developers interact with their REST APIs.
    It knows about your models relationships and let you handle nested restful resources, hypermedia, ETags, etc. easily.
    As Angular 2.0 is coming soon, I'm creating the new version of Restangular
    which will be using all the goodies from Angular 2.0 and ES6.
    I'm going to show code example of usages of the new Restangular 2.0 API and talk about how some of the interals of the library work.
