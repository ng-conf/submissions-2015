  Title: Introducing Yeoman Angular Generator 1.0.0
  Description: >
    May 7, 2013 was my first commit to the Yeoman Angular generator. Since then
    I've been hooked. It's been over a year but the major rewrite to the
    generator is now ready for the public and this will go over some of the new
    features (including opinionated best practices for setting up an Angular 1.x
    project).

    Some of the big improvements to the generator are:
      - Directory organization: by feature (module), by type (existing), or
        random pile of files! (j/k on that last one, maybe)
      - Choice of CSS/Sass (Ruby or Node versions)/Less/Stylus
      - Bootstrap only? Not anymore
      - Completely composable (extend to your heart's content)
      - Protractor and Karma support
      - I Grunt'ed then I Gulp'ed. But I can Grunt or Gulp
