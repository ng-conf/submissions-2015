Session:
  Title: (On) the illusion of stardom.
  Description: >
    This talk is about the AngularJS community and the utter lack of rock stars in it.

    As active members of this community, we are very passionate about it, and we strongly believe that its
    strength lies not in the power of one but in the combined power of all. So letâ€™s take a moment and talk
    about what makes this community what it is and how we can become even more powerful, constructive and
    welcoming for everyone.
