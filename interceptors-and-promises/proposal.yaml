  Title: "Interceptors and Promises: A Love Story"
  Description: >
    Angular HTTP interceptors are awesome and promises are even awesom-er! Together, they are like
    the Beyonce and Jay-Z of Angular - a power couple that are impressive individually but
    unstoppable when combined. Fully leveraging the possibilities of interceptors requires a
    good understanding of the capabilities of the Promises API. But the problem is that this can be
    a little difficult to develop just by reading the docs.

    In this talk we'll explore the union of interceptors and promises by example, going beyond the
    usual authorization or error-handling use-cases to something more substantial: adding run-time
    JSON validation to HTTP requests and responses. Furthermore, we'll see how the Promises API
    allows us to easily orchestrate additional asynchronous tasks alongside our original HTTP
    requests - in this case, recursively loading JSON Schema files on-demand whilst still handling
    errors correctly.

    Attendees will leave with their minds expanded to the full possibilities of HTTP interceptors
    and the Promises API. They'll see how they can write asynchronous HTTP code that is easier to
    understand and reason about. And they'll get to feel the love that promises and interceptors
    share. It truly is a match made in heaven!
