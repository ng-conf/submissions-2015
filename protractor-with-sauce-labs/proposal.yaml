  Title: Cross Platform Testing with Protractor on Sauce Labs
  Description: >
    Protractor is awesome, but unless you have access to a device lab or an army of virtual
    machines, you're still limited to testing in the environment you work in. Sauce Labs
    provides automated testing across a multitude of platforms, browsers and devices.
    Using nothing more than a bit of configuration code, you can verify that your application
    works as expected in virtually any environment your users throw at you. Give me 5 minutes
    and I'll show you how to drastically improve your automated QA.
  Length: 5 # sessions are 5 or 20 minutes long
