  Title: Putting Front-End Developers in the Driver's Seat
  Description: >
    The combination of AngularJS, static hosting, and backend as a service offerings
    represents an exciting new paradigm for app delivery that decouples front-end
    developers from backend battles and liberates them to move full-speed ahead on
    what they do best- refining their craft building great end-user experiences.
    The state of the art in web development is better than ever, with a robust suite
    of tools and services enabling amazing productivity, even for highly sophisticated
    HTML5 single page applications. Letâ€™s leave the infrastructure red tape behind
    and examine a couple specific examples illustraing how a new generation of web
    applications powered by AngularJS and managed services can put front-end developers
    in charge of their app's destiny.
