  Title: Rule mobile with one Angular app
  Description: >
    Let's start building cross platform mobile apps and mobile websites with one
    codebase using the Ionic Framework. Apps have to behave differently on
    mobile devices, and Ionic provides many user interface components needed by
    today's mobile apps or websites. Using Ionic's components and services,
    discover how to use one codebase for mobile websites that also can be built
    into hybrid mobile apps.
