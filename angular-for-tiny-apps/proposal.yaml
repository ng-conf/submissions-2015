  Title: Angular.js for Tiny Apps
  Description: >
    Angular.js is commonly used in large single-page applications.
    A lot of success can be had by using Angular.js to build out small or tiny applications.
    The directives Angular.js provides are a powerful way to organize your code and two-way binding makes managing the views simple.
    Two way binding along with session, cookie, and ajax based backend storages become simple details to work with and switch out.
    I've built out several of these including http://todayisasuccess.com and http://yearscheduler.com.
    Both pages were built out in about an afternoon.
