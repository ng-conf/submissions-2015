Session:
  Title: Angular in the Classroom: Building a Realtime Experience with Angular and Socket.IO
  Description: >
    Schools have notoriously bad networks. Steel lockers, cinder blocks, and outdated technology strangle the network.
    Whatever bandwidth is left is swallowed by hundreds or thousands of students connecting at the same time.
    Yet making a difference in the classroom demands an interactive, beautiful, uninterupted online experience.
    Using Angular and Socket.IO we demonstrate how we overcame these challenges at Amplify Education.
    We will provide tips you can use to make your apps more reactive, easier to maintain, and a joy to use.
