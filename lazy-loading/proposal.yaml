  Title: The Amblyopia of Angular... (i.e. lazy loading)
  Description: >
    Single page apps (SPAs) are awesome. The user perceives them to be faster, their easier to reason about, etc. etc. etc.
    However, one drawback to a traditional SPA is that the user is essentially downloading and installing your entire
    application every time they go to it. Can you imagine having to download and install the Twitter app on your phone
    every time you wanted to check up on the latest from @js_dev? Crazy talk. Besides, 99% of the time, you don't even need
    the profile portion, or the settings piece, so why would you want to load that stuff?
    Enter: Lazy loading. It's a concept that says you can load pieces of the application as they're needed. This dramatically
    improves load time of Angular applications and in this talk we'll walk through refactoring code to lazy load a feature
    of an application as well as creating a build to break out features into separate files to be loaded lazily.
    After this talk, you should be able to go back to your applications and with relative ease, lazy load the snot out of
    them. It'll be awesome.
