  Title: "Lift-ng: Secure, rapid web development with Scala and AngularJS"
  Description: >
    In this talk I present lift-ng, an open-source library which extends the Scala-based Lift web framework into a productive, powerful, and secure Angular backend.

    How do we enable Angular application developers to be highly productive without neglecting security?  
    Using Scala’s elegantly malleable syntax, we have created a DSL which gives the appearance of extending Angular down to the server.  
    Like Angular's model/view binding, lift-ng can also extend binding down to the backend via client/server model binding.
    All of this functionality is delivered using Lift’s proven security features to ensure the application is secure by default.

    To demo this backend library I show code snippets from a simple chat application.  
    The code base exercises the three primary feature sets of lift-ng:
      1. Client-initiated server calls are utilized to send chat messages to the server.
      2. Server-initiated events announce new users have joined the chat.
      3. Client/server model binding seamlessly keeps the chat log in sync on the client.
