  Title: CRUD app in a box using forms-angular
  Description: >
    We all know how cool’n’trendy it is to generate your forms from JSON - there  are loads of libraries that do that.
    But you still have to write the JSON.   And if you want to persist the data you will need a database schema.  And an
    API.  And reports.  In this talk you will learn how to use forms-angular to  get the database schema to do the heavy
    lifting, and explore some of the  architectural choices that were made in the library and how they relate to  other
    frameworks.

      Following a very brief “career” in showbiz Mark spent decades developing  software for the social care sector,
      during which time he had a few successful start-ups (and regrettable exits).  For the last few years he  has been
      trying unsuccessfully to show the UK government (local and  central) how to use open source and open data to
      improve elderly care.   Now he has probably retired.  He’ll know in a few years.

    Vincent, from Belgium, has a scientific background and holds a PhD in cosmology. Recently, he started up a
    consulting company in software development and data analysis. He likes challenging the limits (if any)  of AngularJS
    with drawing or desktop app frameworks. On Saturdays, you’ll meet him with either a squash racket or skis in hands,
    or both.
