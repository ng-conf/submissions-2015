  Title: Restoring the Peace with JSON Validation and Angular
  Description: >
    Using JSON as a data interchange format is awesome - until it isn't. That's when the
    recriminations between front-end and back-end devs start: "You spelt that property name wrong!"
    "Why are you passing me an integer when I need a float?" "What do you mean you're using a
    numeric timestamp for dates, I wanted a human-readable string!"

    Testing tools like Protractor can help to a certain degree, but wouldn't it be great if there
    was a way to specify the format of your JSON? Oh wait, there is: it's called JSON Schema!

    In this presentation we'll do a quick intro to JSON Schema, then dive into how Angular makes it
    spectacularly easy to hook JSON schema validation into your app using the power of interceptors
    and promises. Finally, we'll look at the pros and cons of using Angular with Swagger, which is a
    standard for specifying RESTful APIs with JSON.

    Attendees will leave with an understanding of how best they can use JSON schema validation to
    eliminate a whole range of bugs from their Angular apps, restoring at least a little peace and
    harmony to their development teams.
