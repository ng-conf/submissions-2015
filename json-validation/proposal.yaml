  Title: Restoring the Peace with JSON Validation and Swagger
  Description: >
    Using JSON as a data interchange format is awesome - until it isn't. That's when the
    recriminations between front-end and back-end devs start: "You spelt that property name wrong!"
    "Why are you passing me an integer when I need a float?" "What do you mean you're using a
    numeric timestamp for dates, I wanted a human-readable string!"

    Testing tools like Protractor can help to a certain degree, but wouldn't it be great if there
    was a way to specify the format of your JSON?

    In this presentation we'll take a look at a couple of the different options that are available
    to you right now for validating JSON. We'll then see how Angular makes it spectacularly
    easy to hook JSON schema validation into your app using the power of interceptors and promises.
    Finally, we'll look at the pros and cons of using Angular with Swagger, which is a standard for
    specifying entire RESTful APIs with JSON.

    Attendees will leave with an understanding of how best they can use JSON schema validation to
    eliminate a whole range of bugs from their Angular apps, restoring at least a little peace and
    harmony to their development teams.
