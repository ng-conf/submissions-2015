  Title: Optimization techniques for AngularJS apps
  Description: >
    In this session, I'm not going to show you a list of rules on how to speed up your AngularJS apps. That's just 
    boring!  Instead of that, I'm going to give you a new set of eyes to do that. You will finally learn how to find, 
    debug, benchmark the performance issues and how to fix them.
