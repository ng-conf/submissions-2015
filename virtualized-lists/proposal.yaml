Session:
  Title: Performance and Better Living Through Virtualized Lists
  Description: >
    A really fast, scrollable, long list of data.  You can do it natively on iOS and Android.
    How about on Angular JS?  Many application developers find themselves needing to provide
    a fast, scalable user interface capable of meeting the high expectations users have
    grown to expect from interacting with native applications. This session will demonstrate
    several alternative techniques for interacting with large data sets.   We’ll explore the
    concepts of virtualized lists and how the same techniques utilized during the development
    of user interface components  for native applications may be applied to AngularJS
    applications.   There are several existing solutions for virtualized lists in
    Angular.  We’ll compare and contrast the various offerings and help you choose
    the right solution for your particular needs.
